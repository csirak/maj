# Maj: A BASED Language Inspired by Adam Majmudar's GPU Project

## Overview

Maj is a high-performance, statically typed programming language designed to leverage GPU computing capabilities seamlessly. Inspired by [Adam Majmudar's GPU project](https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu), Maj aims to simplify the development of GPU-accelerated applications by integrating GPU programming directly into the language syntax and runtime. Built using Scala.

## Features

- **Static Typing**: Catch errors early with a strong, statically typed system that ensures type safety without sacrificing flexibility.
- **Performance Optimization**: Automatic performance optimizations for GPU operations, reducing the need for manual optimization.
- **Concise Syntax**: A syntax that is expressive yet concise, minimizing boilerplate while maximizing readability and productivity.

## Installation
